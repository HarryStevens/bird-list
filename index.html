						The list to the left shows the unlucky thirteen birds that have been hit the most by airplanes departing from or arriving at <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/airports/">Port Authority airports</a>. <strong><em>Click on a bird card to see more data on the number of times each bird has been struck over the years.</em></strong>

					<p>
						The <a href="http://www.nyharborparks.org/visit/jaba.html">Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge</a>, an internationally-recognized Important Bird Area, lies directly adjacent to John F. Kennedy International Airport, which handles more air traffic than almost any other airport in the world. The only nesting colony of Laughing Gulls, number five on the list to the left, lies directly next to the JFK runways.
					</p>
					<p>
						“This is obviously a fundamental conflict,” says Tod Winston, communications manager for the <a href="http://www.nycaudubon.org/">New York City Audubon Society</a>. Like JFK, many of the area’s airports lie on land that was once marsh, making it ideal nesting grounds for waterbirds like Herring Hulls (#1), Ring-billed Gulls (#9), Mallards (#10) and Canada Geese (#13). This results in a “great number of waterbirds” being mauled by low-flying aircraft, according to Winston. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Other factors increase the chances of certain species of birds succumbing to fast-flying planes. Birds like starlings (#3), Killdeer (#8) and Eastern Meadowlarks (#12) that flock in large groups instead of flying solo are likely to be killed in large numbers. Birds are also attracted to airports’ open spaces, where predators like Barn Owls (#11) and American Kestrels (#2) &ndash; a small species of falcon &ndash; hunt for prey. Barn Swallows (#4), too, hunt for insects in open fields.

						Sometimes called a sparrow hawk, the American Kestrel is actually a small species of falcon. This hearty predator can live just about anywhere, from the frigid climes north of the Arctic Circle down to the temperate tropics of Central America and up into the high elevations of the Andes mountains. It often hunts in the open spaces over airports. It hunts over airports’ open spaces, seeking mice, lizards, grasshoppers and small birds.
